## v0.38.0 | 3 Sep 2022

### Optimum Range Detection

- New analysis: `pkgs.analyses.optimumrange.FindOptimumRange` finds the optimum for a
  variable in binned other variable. This is useful for e.g. detecting the air temperature
  range where CO2 uptake was highest (=most negative).

### Cumulative and Anomaly Plots

- New plot: `core.plotting.cumulative.CumulativeYear` plots cumulative sums per year

  specfied threshold value to the threshold.

  Series and DataFrame data

## v0.33.0 | 26 Jul 2022

### MeteoScreening Preparations

- Added new class `core.times.times.TimestampSanitizer`
    - Class that handles timestamp checks and fixes, such as the creation of a continuous
      timestamp without date gaps.
- Added `pkgs.createvar.nighttime_latlon.nighttime_flag_from_latlon`
    - Function for the calculation of a nighttime flag (1=nighttime) from latitude and
      longitude coordinates of a specific location.
- Added `core.plotting.heatmap_datetime.HeatmapDateTime`
    - Class to generate a heatmap plot from timeseries data.

## v0.32.0 | 22 Jul 2022

### MeteoScreening Air Temperature

MeteoScreening uses a general settings file `pipes_meteo.yaml` that contains info how
specific `measurements` should be screened. Such `measurements` group similar variables
together, e.g. different air temperatures are measurement `TA`.   
Additions to module `pkgs.qaqc.meteoscreening`:

- Added class `ScreenVar`
    - Performs quality screening of air temperature `TA`.
    - As first check, I implemented outlier detection via the newly added package `ThymeBoost`,
      along with checks for absolute limits.
    - Screening applies the checks defined in the file `pipes_meteo.yaml` for the respective
      `measurement`, e.g. `TA` for air temperature.
    - The screening outputs a separate dataframe that contains `QCF` flags for each check.
    - The checks do not change the original time series. Instead, only the flags are generated.
    - Screening routines for more variables will be added over the next updates.
- Added class `MeteoScreeningFromDatabaseSingleVar`
    - Performs quality screening *and* resampling to 30MIN of variables downloaded from the database.
    - It uses the `detailed` data when downloading data from the database using `dbc-influxdb`.
    - The `detailed` data contains the measurement of the variable, along with multiple tags that
      describe the data. The tags are needed for storage in the database.
    - After quality screening of the original high-resolution data, flagged values are removed and
      then data are resampled.
    - It also handles the issue that data downloaded for a specific variable can have different time
      resolution over the years, although I still need to test this.
    - After screening and resampling, data are in a format that can be directly uploaded to the
      database using `dbc-influxdb`.
- Added class `MeteoScreeningFromDatabaseMultipleVars`
    - Wrapper where multiple variables can be screened in one run.
    - This should also work in combination of different `measurements`. For example, screening
      radiation and temperature data in one run.

- Added module `thymeboost`

## v0.30.0 | 15 Feb 2022

### Starting diive library

#### **GENERAL**

The `diive` library contains packages and modules that aim to facilitate working
with time series data, in particular ecosystem data.

Previous versions of `diive` included a GUI. The GUI component will from now on
be developed separately as `diive-gui`, which makes use of the `diive` library.

Previous versions of `diive` (up to v0.22.0) can be found in the separate repo
[diive-legacy](https://gitlab.ethz.ch/diive/diive-legacy).

This initial version of the `diive` library contains several first versions of
packages that will be extended with the next versions.

Notable introduction in this version is the package `echires` for working with
high-resolution eddy covariance data. This package contains the module `fluxdetectionlimit`,
which allows the calculation of the flux detection limit following Langford et al. (2015).

#### **NEW PACKAGES**

- Added `common`: Common functionality, e.g. reading data files
- Added `pkgs > analyses`: General analyses
- Added `pkgs > corrections`: Calculate corrections for existing variables
- Added `pkgs > createflag`: Create flag variables, e.g. for quality checks
- Added `pkgs > createvar`: Calculate new variables, e.g. potential radiation
- Added `pkgs > echires`: Calculations for eddy covariance high-resolution data, e.g. 20Hz data
- Added `pkgs > gapfilling`: Gap-filling routines
- Added `pkgs > outlierdetection`: Outlier detection
- Added `pkgs > qaqc`: Quality screening for timeseries variables

#### **NEW MODULES**

- Added `optimumrange` in `pkgs > analyses`
- Added `gapfinder` in `pkgs > analyses`
- Added `offsetcorrection` in `pkgs > corrections`
- Added `setto_threshold` in `pkgs > corrections`
- Added `outsiderange` in `pkgs > createflag`
