## v0.30.0 | 15 Feb 2022

### Starting diive library

#### **GENERAL**
The `diive` library contains packages and modules that aim to facilitate working
with time series data, in particular ecosystem data.

Previous versions of `diive` included a GUI. The GUI component will from now on
be developed separately as `diive-gui`, which makes use of the `diive` library.

Previous versions of `diive` (up to v0.22.0) can be found in the separate repo 
[diive-legacy](https://gitlab.ethz.ch/holukas/diive-legacy).

This initial version of the `diive` library contains several first versions of 
packages that will be extended with the next versions. 

Notable introduction in this version is the package `echires` for working with
high-resolution eddy covariance data. This package contains the module `fluxdetectionlimit`,
which allows the calculation of the flux detection limit following Langford et al. (2015).

#### **NEW PACKAGES**
- Added `common`: Common functionality, e.g. reading data files
- Added `pkgs > analyses`: General analyses
- Added `pkgs > corrections`: Calculate corrections for existing variables
- Added `pkgs > createflag`: Create flag variables, e.g. for quality checks
- Added `pkgs > createvar`: Calculate new variables, e.g. potential radiation
- Added `pkgs > echires`: Calculations for eddy covariance high-resolution data, e.g. 20Hz data
- Added `pkgs > flux`: Flux-specific analyses
- Added `pkgs > gapfilling`: Gap-filling routines
- Added `pkgs > outlierdetection`: Outlier detection
- Added `pkgs > qaqc`: Quality screening for timeseries variables

#### **NEW MODULES**
- Added `optimumrange` in `pkgs > analyses`
- Added `gapfinder` in `pkgs > analyses`
- Added `offsetcorrection` in `pkgs > corrections`
- Added `setto_threshold` in `pkgs > corrections`
- Added `outsiderange` in `pkgs > createflag`
- Added `potentialradiation` in `pkgs > createvar`
- Added `fluxdetectionlimit` in `pkgs > echires`
- Added `carboncost` in `pkgs > flux`
- Added `criticalheatdays` in `pkgs > flux`
- Added `interpolate` in `pkgs > gapfilling`
- Added `hampel` in `pkgs > outlierdetection`
- Added `meteoscreening` in `pkgs > qaqc`
